### What does leadership inside the Codeuino mean?

Leader is someone who can help in the creation, planning, and grooming of the things inside the community alongside establishing a flow to help other contributors easily take work in process.

### Importance of Leadership to us

The open-source culture is collaborative, contributing upstream is only the first step in shaping an open-source project’s progression. Taking an active role in guiding or influencing the project’s direction is critically essential as it helps us to refine our boundaries for a better outcome.  We need someone to direct the vision of creation, planning, and architecture of our social networking objectives
