# Setting up the work environment.

Few things are required before setting up the project locally,

 - **A Web Browser** - You can install any browser as per your preference e.g. Internet Explorer,Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Opera etc. JavaScript works on any web browser on any OS. 
 - **An Editor**-  We prefer an editor which has built-in features of IntelliSense support and syntax error highlighter for speedy development.  Download Visual Studio Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
 - **Node and Node Package Manager(NPM)**
  Check if node and npm are already installed by running the following commands in the terminal
	```
	node -v
	npm -v
	```
If not install it in,
 - **Windows & MacOS**

	Installing Node and NPM on Windows and macOS is straightforward because you can just use the 		provided installer:
	Go to https://nodejs.org/en/
	Select the button to download the LTS build that is "Recommended for most users".
	Install Node by double-clicking on the downloaded file and following the installation prompts.

 - **Ubuntu**
	 The easiest way to install the most recent LTS version of Node 10.x is to use the [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) to get it from the Ubuntu _binary distributions_ repository. This can be done very simply by running the following two commands on your terminal:
	```
	curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash - 
	sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
	```
