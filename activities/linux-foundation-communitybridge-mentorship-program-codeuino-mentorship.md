# Linux Foundation CommunityBridge Mentorship Program - Codeuino Mentorship

### CommunityBridge by The Linux Foundation

[Community Bridge](https://communitybridge.org/) is a platform developed by **The Linux Foundation**, which accelerates the adoption, innovation, and sustainability of open-source software.

Community Bridge is actively used by the Codeuino as a mentorship platform across its projects and can be found with the name "[**Codeuino Mentorship**](https://people.communitybridge.org/project/7deb8e48-6797-4115-bb96-9cf4ccee022e)" on the CommunityBridge Platform.

### **Codeuino Mentorship**

**Codeuino Mentorship** is a 3 months program, run under The Linux Foundation CommunityBridge platform for various "**terms**" in a year.

This program is designed to help developers with the necessary skills - experiment, learn, and contribute effectively to open source communities, which can initially seem overwhelmingly vast.

{% hint style="info" %}
"**Terms**" here means a different time period. For example, currently, we have for Summer2020. It can be Fall, Winter, or Spring time period and these different time periods reflect as "terms". Any name can be given to terms. 
{% endhint %}

Following are the core goals of the Mentorship Program:

* Help mentees learn and enhance their technical skills, and inspire them to become long-term active contributors.
* Teach aspiring developers the open-source culture and collaboration norms, and guide them to participate in the open-source community more effectively by using collaboration tools and infrastructure.
* Strengthen projects and the communities that are crucial to the Linux ecosystem by improving security and quality of releases.
* Provide a skilled and diverse talent pool of prospective employees trained by experts to companies in the ecosystem of related technology.
* Add well-trained and educated diverse talent to projects, and inspire them to write code for open-source software products for the benefit of the entire community and users.

### Program Structure for "Term: Summer 2020"

| Time Period | Purpose |
| :---: | :---: |
| **July 1, 2020 - July 20, 2020** | Mentees submit applications |
| **July 25, 2020** | Mentees are announced |
| **August 1, 2020** | The official coding period starts |
| **October 31, 2020** | Coding period ends |

### Phase-by-Phase Process

1. **Reviewing Submitted Application:** After you submit your application, and apply to project\(s\), it takes a minimum of two weeks of time to evaluate your application. You are advised to complete the prerequisite tasks during this time period failing which your application will not be considered for the mentorship program. You can check your application status by navigating to your Linux Foundation account. 
2. **Mentee Contract:** If you are selected for the mentorship program, you will be contacted through email or phone, and you will have to undergo contract and HR processes.
3. **Mentee Working:** This is the time when you actually learn and contribute to the community. During this period, you are expected to dedicate your quality time, and work with your mentor in structuring a project planning, understanding open-source culture, development tooling and infrastructure, making steady progress towards completing objectives, milestones, and tasks as defined in the project plan, and actively contribute to the community to successfully complete the course. You can start by making small contributions to the projects. You are highly encouraged to contribute to documentation.
4. **Evaluation:** You will be evaluated on a periodic basis by your mentors. The reason behind this is to get feedback from your mentor about your progress and to check if you are completing your objectives and milestones as per the project planning, and are actively participating in community discussions, and so on. **Note:** Depending on the project, there will be three or four evaluations during the entire program. Based on your evaluation report, the stipend will be released.
5. **Stipend:** Payments happen after completion of each evaluation time. Stipends are released if your evaluation report shows satisfactory progress of your mentorship training. The total stipend amount is paid phase-wise after each evaluation, and the stipend amount for each evaluation varies from project to project. 
6. **Letter of Completion:** If you successfully finish the program by completing all your project milestones, deliverables, and assigned tasks, which may include an exam, you will also be asked to write and publish a blog to receive a digital Letter of Completion at the end of the program. Hurray! You graduated. **Note:** Get in touch with your Program Manager or Mentor to help you with writing and publishing a blog.
