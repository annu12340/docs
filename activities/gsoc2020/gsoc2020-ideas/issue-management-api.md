# Issue Management API inside Codebadge

### **Priority:**

High

### **Description:**

In Codebadge, presently all the badge allotment computation are taking place on the basis of comment count. We want to create a smarter approach to give each user its token of appreciation. Moreover CRON jobs approach which is being followed at present is pretty slow and hence need to optimist it. Trello dashboard being an awesome tool to manage Issue and pull requests is something we would like to take into consideration as a platform to manage the tasks and issues. The task to be performed under this project are:-

* Creating a Webhook which fires when a issue is made on the project. This webhook link shall be provided to the admin at the time of adding an organization to his/her dashboard.
* Admin dashboard interact with Trello to add a new card on related section by using classification algorithm of machine learning.
* Trello award points are set at issue card on trello which are awarded using badge and point allotment system.
* Issue award points must be visible on github issue section.
* Card must be moved or deleted respectively whenever needed on the basis of development. Awards must be updated in case of shift.
* Auto assigning issue on the basis of past issue solutions.
* Update database schema wherever required with an efficient schema design.
* Reward point updates in database for issue and updating badges on basis of points.
