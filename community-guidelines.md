# Community Guidelines

**Be welcoming and open-minded** - Other collaborators may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new collaborators and those just getting started. We value, encourage all types of contributions. We don’t assume you can contribute for free, we respect and thank.

**Be honest -** Being honest helps you to move to a better consensus building. So Be honest about who you are, what you do, and how you want to do it. Dishonesty is not only damaging to you but to all other community members and their valuable contributions. Don’t be the one bringing mistrust into this community.

**Be Kind -** We value caring for others. Demonstrating we care for people provides an effective framework for challenging directly and delivering feedback.  We're all for accurate assessment, but we think it must be done in a kind way. Give as much positive feedback as you can, and do it in a public way.

**Be considerate** - Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect the users and the contributors working on a particular project, So you should keep those consequences in mind while making any decision.

**Be collaborative -** Codeuino community has various projects which work on the basis of working together and collaboration. So Collaboration is an essential part for us. Collaboration between teams that each user has their own goal and vision which is essential; for the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.

**Be thoughtful and stick to topic -** The Codeuino community is the house of social networking projects. So being a social networking community it fulfills social needs to interact with people around the globe. So off-topic comments are sometimes unproductive while collaborating. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions. Additionally, communicating with strangers on the Internet can be difficult. It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person.

**Be apologize** - If you made a mistake, apologize as soon as possible. Saying sorry is not a sign of weakness but one of strength. The people that do the most work will likely make the most mistakes. Additionally, when we share our mistakes and bring attention to them, others can learn from us, and the same mistake is less likely to be repeated by someone else. Mistakes can include when you have not been kind to someone. In order to reinforce our values, it is important, and takes more courage, to apologize publicly when you have been unkind publicly \(e.g., when you have said something unkind or unprofessional to an individual or group in a Slack channel\).

**Be helpful -** Keep an eye out for others who may be struggling or stuck. If you see someone who needs help, reach out and assist, or connect them with someone else who can provide expertise or assistance. We succeed and shine together!
