# Google Season of Docs 2020

## Welcome to Google Season of Docs with Codeuino

[**Google Season of Docs**](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/) is a global program which encourages technical writers to gain an exposure to documentations of real-world open source project scenarios either by building a new documentation set, or redesigning the existing docs, or improving and documenting the open source community's contribution procedures and on-boarding experience to transmute their technical skills to greater levels

Google awards stipends, to all successful technical writer who complete their documentation of open-source projects under [**Codeuino**](http://www.codeuino.org/).

## **Involving as a Mentor**

Potential mentors are invited to assign themselves on the projects they want to mentor this summer under Codeuino community. The person who is willing to mentor takes up the project within the community and propose it under GSoD on the basis of involvement and prior knowledge of tech writing in it.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week \(more at the start, less at the end\). In return, a student works on your project full time for 3 months. Think about the projects that youâ€™ve always wanted to do but could not find the time.

**Consider proposing your own ideas as well that match the community project style**.

Make sure you get through the **"**[**Mentor Guide**](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/mentor-guide)**"**

### Expectations from a mentor

1. **Commit to spending a minimum of 4 hours each week** to be available to guide and mentor students \(not just your assigned student\).
2. **Commit to being present** in SLACK to help answer questions as much as your schedule allows, at a minimum of 4 hours each week.
3. **Prepare a good overview of your project** idea\(s\)
4. **Review student proposals** and work with other mentors and organization admins to select the best candidates for Codeuino.
5. **Ensure your Student is Active.** They should have a good community involvement and good discussions. Should be answerable wherever they are tagged.
6. **Reach out to the Season of Docs organization administrators** if you have questions or concerns.
7. **Do weekly meeting with students and give weekly report to Organization Admins.**
