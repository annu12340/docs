# Our Values

Just like the rest of our work, we continually adjust our values and strive to make them better. The Codeuino community values are a living document. In many instances, they have been documented, refined, and revised based on lessons learned in the course of working effectively and efficiently.

So this section is our core which reflects **how we organize ourselves**, **community guidelines**, **community ethics**, all the way down to **how we remunerate ourselves**!

Everyone is welcome to suggest improvements.

**The Codeuino community** is a value-driven organization and here is what we believed in:

### üå± **Sustainability:**

Our mission is focused on creating open sustainability within social networking and build OSS/FOSS social-environmental tools with a sole motive to benefit organizations and individuals to have a common platform for collaboration. What we really mean by the ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù codeuino's project is where the core contributors have a _sustainable interest_ in keeping the project going, getting others to use it, helping it to be maintained at a certain level, responding to bug reports, developing new innovations and so forth. We can‚Äôt achieve our mission unless we are sustainable in doing it. We take a broad definition of sustainability as social networking, community health, and individual sustainability in the collaboration.

### \*\*\*\*üëê **Openness:**

Openness is the key to any open source project. Work within the Codeuino community is primarily organized around social networking.  ****So following through the definition of the openness The Codeuino community is dedicated to fostering an open and welcoming environment for contributors. For starters, we provide the same level of source code available to all developers, meaning there is no favoritism to developers via priority access. Anyone can join the mailing list, participate in video conferencing meetings, or contribute to any of our projects on GitHub at any time! _We strive to be open!_

We encourage contributions through the visible recognition of the contributors and the provision of a transparent contribution and acceptance process that provides clear feedback on updates to contributions as they are incorporated into the project.
