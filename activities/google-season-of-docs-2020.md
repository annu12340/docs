The person who is willing to mentor takes up the project within the community and propose it under GSoD on the basis of involvement and prior knowledge of tech writing in it.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week \(more at the start, less at the end\). In return, a student works on your project full time for 3 months. Think about the projects that youâ€™ve always wanted to do but could not find the time.
