# Path to Leadership

### Importance of Leadership to us

The open source culture is collaborative, contributing upstream is only the first step in shaping an open source project’s progression. Taking an active role in guiding or influencing the project’s direction is critically important as it helps us to refine our boundaries for a better outcome.  We need someone to direct the vision of creation, planning, and architecture of our social networking objectives
