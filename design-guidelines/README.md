### What is CodeUino Design?

As the community is being mobilized, and as all its members participate in the choices about what action to undertake in design, it becomes useful to combine those choices and decisions and lay some guidelines. CodeUino Design is a place where we aim to solve design issues and improve the design structure of our platforms.

We aim to solve the design issues and bring the community closer through regular discussions and brain storming sessions. This helps keep the community intact and grow in a larger scale.



### What are we trying to achieve?

We as a community are trying to achieve a certain number of goals through design.

* Well defined and constructed design solutions for community products and maintain standard design guidelines and design library. 
* Bring the community together through design sprints and regular discussions over designs. 
* Build a better bridge between designers and developers to speed up the processes and improve the productivity.



### Why should you contribute?

Although, Open source is majorly for developers, our organization opened gates for designers as well. We believe that anyone can leave their mark on an important piece of open software or create their own “next big thing”. There are several reasons why you should contribute in design.

* Being part of an open source project can also help you improve your skills and learn new tools and processes. 
* Our community consists of some amazing peeps from whom you could get mentorship, mentor others or form life long friendships. 
* Design varies in every company and community. We adapt the latest and the most trusted methods to ideate, create and design for our platforms.



### How can you contribute?

You can contribute to the community in several ways.

* User Interface Design \(UI\) 
* User Experience Design \(UX\)
