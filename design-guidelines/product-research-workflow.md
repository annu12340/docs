# Product Research Workflow

## Our Aim

Our aim through this procedure is to find and validate the current trending features which users want to see in social networking projects. 

## Our Process

We follow a 4-step process for product research and finding new ideas. Each step is a forward move towards a contribution

* **Discovery** **:** Empathize and find the potential users. Study their behaviour, interactions, expectations, etc.
* **Explore :** Explore the different features provided by other products and different needs of users
* **Ideate :** Finalize the ideas and validate them
* **Test :** Test the prototypes and take valuable feedbacks



### Why this Process?

There are several reasons for selecting this process.

* Exploration of ideas and users plays a very crucial role in part of product research. If you target the wrong users for study then this will create an enormous problem in further stages.
* Along with these exploration of different features are also very important. This part works as a base of thinking of new ideas and improving the current ideas
* And at last ideation and testing stage involves the part of discovering and finalising new features.
